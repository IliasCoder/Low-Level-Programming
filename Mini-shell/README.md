üéØ Overview

This project implements a production-ready mini-shell from scratch in C, demonstrating advanced systems programming concepts including:

Custom memory management without relying on standard library functions
Process creation and management using fork(), exec(), and wait()
Circular buffer implementation for efficient command history storage
Low-level I/O operations using system calls
Signal handling for graceful interrupt management
Command parsing and execution with argument separation

Perfect for understanding operating systems internals, process management, and systems programming fundamentals.

‚ú® Features
üöÄ Core Functionality
Real command execution - Execute system programs with arguments
Interactive command line - Full terminal interaction with character echoing
Command history - Circular buffer storing last 10 commands
History replay - Execute previous commands with !! and !n
Built-in commands - Essential shell operations
Process management - Proper child process handling and cleanup
üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Features
Custom string functions - No dependency on string.h
Memory leak prevention - Comprehensive cleanup and error handling
Signal handling - Graceful Ctrl+C handling and zombie process prevention

üî¨ Technical Implementation
Memory Management Strategy

The shell implements a zero-leak memory management system:

// Custom memory allocation with error checking
char *my_strdup(const char *str) {
    if (!str) return NULL;
    
    int len = my_strlen(str);
    char *dup = malloc(len + 1);
    
    if (!dup) {
        write(STDERR_FILENO, "Memory allocation failed\n", 25);
        return NULL;
    }
    
    my_strcpy(dup, str);
    return dup;
}

Process Execution Model
// Fork-exec-wait pattern for command execution
int execute_external_command(Command *cmd) {
    pid_t pid = fork();
    
    if (pid == 0) {
        // Child process: execute command
        execvp(cmd->args[0], cmd->args);
        exit(127);  // Command not found
    } else if (pid > 0) {
        // Parent process: wait for completion
        int status;
        waitpid(pid, &status, 0);
        return WEXITSTATUS(status);
    }
    
    return -1;  // Fork failed
}

Circular Buffer History
// Efficient O(1) history operations
void add_to_history(Shell *shell, const char *command) {
    int index = (shell->history_start + shell->current_size) % HISTORY_SIZE;
    
    if (shell->current_size == HISTORY_SIZE) {
        // Overwrite oldest command
        free(shell->history[shell->history_start]);
        shell->history_start = (shell->history_start + 1) % HISTORY_SIZE;
    } else {
        shell->current_size++;
    }
    
    shell->history[index] = my_strdup(command);
    shell->history_count++;
}




Development Setup
# Fork and clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/enhanced-mini-shell.git
cd enhanced-mini-shell
it is highly recommended to use a UNIX-based OS like MacOs or Linux. WSL on windows will do the job. because of the sys/wait.h library which is available only on Linux or MacOs compilers.
# Create development branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
