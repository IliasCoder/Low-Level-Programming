# 🖥️ Low-Level Playground

Welcome to my **Low-Level Programming Playground** — a collection of experiments, mini-projects, and odd little programs I’ve created while exploring the guts of computing.  
This repository is my sandbox for everything I like to **dabble with, poke at, and tinker on** — from bare-metal concepts to systems-level utilities.

If you enjoy **bit-twiddling**, **memory poking**, **data structure experiments**, and other programming rabbit holes, you’ll probably feel right at home here.

## 📂 What's Inside

This repo doesn’t follow one single theme — it’s more like a **cabinet of curiosities** for code.  
Some of the areas you might find:

- **Assembly Snippets** — small routines to learn CPU instructions, calling conventions, and optimization tricks.
- **C and C++ Utilities** — data structures, algorithms, and performance experiments.
- **Systems Programming** — OS-level interactions, syscalls, and resource management.
- **Memory & Pointers** — malloc/free playgrounds, pointer arithmetic practice, and buffer manipulations.
- **Low-Level Networking** — sockets, protocols, and minimal clients/servers.
- **Random Experiments** — anything I find fun that teaches me something about how computers *really* work.

Each project has its own folder, usually with:
- `README.md` for project-specific details
- Source code (`.asm`, `.c`, `.cpp`, etc.)
- Build/run instructions
- Notes or commentary (if I learned something worth sharing)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Depending on the project, you might need:
- **GCC / Clang** — for compiling C/C++ code.
- **NASM / GAS** — for assembling low-level programs.
- **Make** — to run provided `Makefile`s.
- A **POSIX-like environment** (Linux/macOS, or WSL on Windows).

### Cloning the Repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/IliasCoder/Low-Level-Programming.git
cd Low-Level-Programming
